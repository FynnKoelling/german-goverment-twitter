This repository contains a short script that outputs for any given Twitter account for the latest 3200 tweets:
- a bar chart with the 15 most used words as .png
- a word cloud with word occurrence over 100 as .png
- a sentiment bar chart as .png.

In this example, we used the six (seven since we split CDU/CSU) current parties in the German Bundestag.

Note that you need a Twitter developer account (https://developer.twitter.com/en) to run this script.
